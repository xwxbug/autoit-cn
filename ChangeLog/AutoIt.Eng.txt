- Changed: The key # is no longer used as a delimiter but as a left Win key combination.  So
           Send("#e") now presses the left win+e keys.  I don't think anyone actually used

           lines easier to read anyway
- Changed: FileReadLine() and FileWriteLine() modified so that they optionally accept a filename
           instead of a filehandle for "quick 'n' dirty" file access - I'm sure this will be
           popular :)

           RunAsSet, Shutdown, RegWrite, RegDelete, WinWait, WinWaitActive, WinWaitClose, WinWaitNotActive,
           ProcessWait, ProcessWaitClose.  If you were using the return values of one of
           these functions then please check your scripts.

	And more text _
	And even more text")



3.0.78 (15th December, 2003)

	All numbers now 15digit precision (internal C double type)

		with the result
